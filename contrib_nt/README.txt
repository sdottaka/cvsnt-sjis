This directory contains scripts converted to use with CVSNT.  They probably don't work with Unix anymore.

The scripts are provided 'as is', and will probably require modification to work on a particular system.

All the scripts require the installation of Perl on the server.

There are also two cvs extension libraries.  One using COM, written in c#, and one using the DLL interface.
Neither of them do very much but are useful as a starting point.
