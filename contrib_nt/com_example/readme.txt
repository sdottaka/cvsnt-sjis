This is a shell COM object.

To invoke it put its class ID in one of the *info files eg.

DEFAULT {A12DA672-74ED-3F65-B0B1-D6A73CA232BB}

Note that class ID will probably be different for you (and should be, if you want anyone else to
be able to use your object).

COM integration requires NT or better.
